During the Project NJR CartEpp
--------------------------------
1. Bringing up linux
	Struggled to get the linux on board for 2 days,
	Problem : Nothing seen on the console, after the Uncompressing linux message...
	Strategies/Investigation: 
		1. Keep removing the device init's one by one from the board_init file :arch/arm/mach-omap2/board-ti8148evm.c.
			--> didnt work
		2. Strip the .config file to the minimum by removing all the drivers and network support
			--> didnt work
		3. debugging in the fire, connect the lauterbach jtag, put vmlinux symbols and look for the stack strace :
			Result :	Found the problem was due to rootfs, it was stuck in the mount_rootfs
		4. built few busyboxes , one from yocto and still could not boot.
		5. Tried altering the bootargs with serveral initrd options.:
		
		Lesson Learned : no need of ramdisk file(built using mkimage) if you pass the ext2.gz directly and use the initrd=<file.gz> on the bootargs
		6. One problem resolved :
			Solution : It was just the console device bootargs issue.
				   I was using the oldstyle ttyS0, and came to know about the new style ttyO0 after a quick chat.
				final bootargs is this simple one : setenv bootargs console=ttyO0,115200n8  root=/dev/ram0 mem=256M 
		 
	Problem : kernel panic from the busybox rootfs, cannot execute the /bin/sh init failed.
